# Health-Assistant
This is basically a Voice Assistant (Health Oriented) which can suggest some heath tips and can also prescribe you the medicines.

In this project One Raspberry Pi is there and Mic and speaker are connected to it... The code for this program is written in Python Programming language which is the official programming language for raspberry pi. Google speech API has been used for speech to text conversion and gTTS has been used for Text to speech conversion... When we say something in the microphone which is connected to raspberry pi.. Then the voice is sent to the cloud to google speed API and it is then converted into text and in the code it is compared to our database...and finds the best suitable results... Then that result is sent to gTTS and then it comes in the mp3 format to the code which played by a command line mp3 player.


At present this device is able to suggest you some heath tips and to prescribe medicines... You might be aware about Alexa , Google assistant or any other voice assistants...but those are just limited to some rubbish tasks which is of no use genuinely.... So we have created this Assistant which can help you genuinely.. This works like this- If you say in the assistant that 'I am suffering from fever' then the assistant will reply ' You can take ****** medicine..' this can also give some health tips by asking. Presently the device is under development stage...In future if will be capable of monitoring the data related to healths....like some necessary sensor will be attached in the patient's body like BP sensor, Diabetes sensor, etc and those will be monitored in the device and will suggest medicines by itself... In future we will implement Artificial Neural networks to train the device by its own so that without saying it can prescribe medicine. In future if will also offer medicines by its own..
